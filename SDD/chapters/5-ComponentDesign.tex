\section{API}
This section covers implementation details for the API of \serviceName.

\subsection{Backend Language}
ExpressJS was chosen to be the backend language of choice for \serviceName.  The reasons why are numerous:
\begin{itemize}
    \item written in JS
    \item simple, flexible, extensible
    \item "One language to rule them all"
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Routes}
At the very least, the necessary routes are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item login: goes through Instagram's auth flow
    \item query: takes in a query object, returns a list of users
\end{itemize}


\section{User Interface}
This section covers implementation details of the UI portion of \serviceName. \serviceName will primarily be web-based. ReactJS will be used as the UI framework. Rationale:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It is the framework I know best
    \item Fits into "one language to rule them all" paradigm
\end{itemize}
